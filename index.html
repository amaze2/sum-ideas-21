<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Summer IDEaS is a library-taught, extra-curricular, project-based, research opportunity that unites traditional research and digital and open humanities (DH), an increasingly ubiquitous approach to scholarship in the humanities that critically engages with data and computing technology. Through the Institute, you’ll learn both longstanding and emerging methods of scholarship that will enable you to achieve and share insight and ready you for an increasingly digital world.</p>

<p>The theme of Summer IDEaS 2021 is “Identity and Power at Union College.” You’ll learn about this theme, DH, and research by individually and collaboratively creating a digital edition in <a href="https://union.manifoldapp.org/" target="_break">Manifold</a> of the diaries of Jonathan Pearson (1813-87), whose connection to Union—as student (class of ’35), professor, librarian, and treasurer—spanned more than a half century.</p>

<p>In so doing, we'll think through the fundamental questions of DH: 
	<ul>
		<li>What is the impact of digital media? What does it enable / disable?</li>
		<li>Who / what gets to be digital?</li>
		<li>How can we use the digital to improve our work? How can the digital make our work usable by others?</li>
		<li>Where can digital items be found? </li>
		<li>When is the digital? (Obsolescence, preservation, and sunsetting)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

<p>To do so, we'll create our own blogs (and blog about it); computationally trace trends across nearly a million words (and more); catch archive fever (and never want to be cured); make our scholarship open (and awesome); and ultimately write, edit, and publish our very own book.</p> 
</section>
