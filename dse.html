    <h1>Digital Scholarly Edition Evaluation / Planning</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Choose a <a href="#dse">digital scholarly edition (DSE) below</a> and examine / evaluate it. Jot down answers to the questions below. (Don't worry if you don't get to all of them.) Then, you'll share your edition and thoughts for discussion.
        <br>
        Your goal is get a sense of what others have done and what can be done in a DSE. This will help you learn what a DSE is and what they can be, and it will help you decide what to do in your projects.</p>
	<ul>
        <li>What do you like / dislike about the DSE you chose? Why?</li> 
        <li>What scholarly apparatus elements would you like to emulate / not emulate in your digital edition?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Annotations:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Is the text(s) annotated?</li>
                <li>What is annotated?</li>
                <li>How much info is provided in the annotation?</li>
                <li>How do the annotations clarify the text?</li>
                <li>Are the annotations in note or glossary format?</li>
                <li>etc.</li>
            </ul>     
           
            <li>Context:</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>What type of contextual materials are provided?</li> 
                <li>Are they included in / alongside the text (links, embedded images, etc.)? Or are they excluded to a separate section?</li>
                <li>Is their relationship to the text explained, or are the contextual materials left to speak for themselves?</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Introduction:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>How is the text introduced? Biographical? Methodological? Interpretive? Something else?</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Interpretation:</li> 
            <ul>
                <li>How is the text interpreted?</li> 
                <li>Are there any computational text analyses + visualizations? Are they explained?</li>
            </ul>
<!--
            <li>Style:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Is the text laid out or styled in a helpful way?</li>
            </ul>
          
        </ul>
		<li>What does the digital format enable that can't be done in print?
            <br>
            (and what does the digital disable that can be done in print?)</li>
        <li>How is the reading experience different / better / worse than a print edition?</li>
          -->

        <h3>Additional Questions to Consider:</h3>
        <ul>   
            <li>Creator(s): Who created / is in charge of the digital edition?</li>
            <li>Platform: How is it hosted / published? A digital publishing platform (which?)? Or some other way?</li>
            <li>Access: Is it for web reading only, or can it also be printed?</li>
            <li>Cost: Is it free / do you have to pay to use it?</li>
            <li>Interactivity: Does it solicit user interaction or user-generated content?</li>
            <li>Documentation: Is the site well explained? </li>
            <li>Audience: Who is its audience(s)?</li>
            <li>Responsive: Is it just as usable on a cell phone as on a PC?</li>
            <li>Longevity: How long has it existed? Is it being maintained / updated? Or is it abandoned?</li>
