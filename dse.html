<section>
    <h2>Assignment</h2>

        <br>

	<ul>
        <li>What do you like / dislike about it? Why?</li> 
        <li>What scholarly apparatus elements would you like to emulate / not emulate in your digital edition?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Annotations: is the text(s) annotated? What is annotated? How much of the text is marked up? How much info is provided? Are the annotations in note or glossary format?</li>
            <li>Style: is the text layed out or styled in a helpful way?</li>
            <li>Context: How is the text(s) contextualized? What contextual materials are provided? Are they included in / alongside the text (links, embedded images, etc.)? Or are they excluded to a separate section? Is their relationship to the text explained, or are they left to speak for themselves?</li>
            <li>Interpretation: How is the text interpreted? Are there any computational text analyses + visualizations? Are they explained? </li>
            <li>Biography / Chronology: how does it illuminate the author's life?</li>
            <li>Introduction: How is the author introduced?</li>
        </ul>
		<li>What does the digital format enable that can't be done in print?
            <br>
            (and what does the digital disable that can be done in print?)</li>
        <li>How is the reading experience different / better / worse than a print edition?</li>

            <li>Platform: How is it hosted / published? A digital publishing platform (which?)? Or some other way?</li>
            <li>Access: Is it for web reading only, or can it also be printed?</li>
            <li>Cost: Is it free / do you have to pay to use it?</li>
            <li>Interactivity: Does it solicit user interaction or user-generated content?</li>
            <li>Documentation: Is the site well explained? </li>
            <li>Audience: Who is its audience(s)?</li>
            <li>Responsive: Is it just as usable on a cell phone as on a PC?</li>
